Recipe website project for TOP.

This website is meant to list recipes on the homepage which the user can navigate to via embedded links. Each recipe has its own webpage which contains the description of the dish, ingredients, and steps to cooking the selected dish. This project is a part of TOP's course and is meant to showcase the ability to create a website using HTML and CSS.

Recipes and images were sourced from allrecipes.com
